# Prodigy-InfoTech

Welcome to my Prodgy Infotech Internship Repository!
This repository contains all the tasks and projects I have completed during my internship at Prodgy Infotech, where I joined as a Data Science Intern. It showcases my progress, learning curve, and hands-on application of key data science concepts such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning. Each project reflects my commitment to mastering real-world datasets and presenting insights in a clear, professional manner.
